## Learning Path Notes

### Recommended Order
1. Complete Phase 1 (Foundations) before moving forward
2. CS229 should be completed before CS230
3. Complete CS230 before starting CS231n
4. Full Stack Deep Learning is best taken after completing computer vision courses
5. NLP (Phase 6) can be studied in parallel with or after Computer Vision

### Alternative Paths
- **Computer Vision Focus:** Prioritize Phase 4, can skip or defer Phase 6
- **NLP Focus:** Prioritize Phase 6, can reduce time on Phase 4
- **ML Engineering Focus:** Emphasize Phases 2, 3, and 5
- **Research Focus:** Deep dive into all phases with emphasis on theory

### Key Prerequisites
- **For all courses:** Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- **For CS229:** Linear algebra, basic probability
- **For CS230:** Completion of CS229 or equivalent ML knowledge
- **For CS231n:** Deep learning fundamentals (CS230 recommended)
- **For Full Stack DL:** At least one deep learning course completed
